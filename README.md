# Ergo Raffle Telegram Bot (Powered by KaChing)
This is the public repo for [@simple_raffle_bot](t.me/simple_raffle_bot), created for the [Ergo Platform Telegram Channel](https://t.me/ergoplatform).

**DISCLAIMER:** This is my first telegram bot AND my first actual web application, therefore any feedback/suggestions are welcome. 


## Features
The bot is configured to notify the tg channel when a raffle on [https://ergoraffle.com/](https://ergoraffle.com/) has:
- received its first donation
- received >= 30% of its desired goal
- received >= 50% of its desired goal
- received >= 90% of its desired goal 
- received >= 100% of its desired goal


The bot also notifies the channel when a raffle has ended. 
In the case of a successful raffle; the winner is announced.




## Roadmap

- Learn to write better js code
- Add time-based notification event 
- Convert "blocks remaining" to "`TIME`" [Useful code found here](https://github.com/ErgoRaffle/raffle-frontend/blob/master/src/components/Day.js)
